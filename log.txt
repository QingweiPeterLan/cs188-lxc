================================== DEBUGGING ==================================

  (1) I got a bug where I could not figure out why the function
      'c->export_container' returned random numbers. I tried debuggin by
      adding new functions to the file 'lxccontainer.c' and changing the
      return types but they always gave random results.

      Then I figured that this might have something to do with the file system
      layout so I simply created a container environment for developing LXC.
      Inside the container I installed the following packages with

        $ sudo apt-get install autotools-dev automake autoconf pkg-config
        $ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic

      I also configured the contianer to allow nested containers by adding the
      following lines to the container configuration file

        lxc.mount.auto = cgroup
        lxc.aa_profile = lxc-container-default-with-nesting

      For my container I added it to the file '/var/lib/lxc/p1/config'.
      Inside the container I installed my version using the following commands

        $ ./autogen.sh
        $ ./configure && make && make install

      Then I created a container and ran my tests

        $ sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n p0
        $ sudo lxc-export -n p0 -e out

      This test finally returned the correct return values as I had put in the
      function in 'lxccontainer.c'.
