------------------------------- LXC Project Log -------------------------------

============================== ENVIRONMENT SETUP ==============================

To setup the environment I had to first setup the environment

  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install autotools-dev automake autoconf pkg-config
  $ sudo apt-get install bridge-utils

Then I installed Linux Containers

  $ cd Desktop/lxc
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure && make && sudo make install

Then I used the following command to get my network cards

  $ sudo ls /sys/class/net

    enp9s0  lo  wlp3s0

Then I create a bridge interface for using Linux Containers

  $ sudo emacs /etc/network/interfaces

    # interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    # bridge name
    auto br0

    # bridge information
    iface br0 inet dhcp
    bridge_ports enp9s0 wlp3s0
    bridge_stp off
    bridge_fd 9
    bridge_maxwait 0

  $ (emacs) C-x C-c
  $ sudo ifup br0
  $ sudo emacs /usr/local/etc/lxc/default.conf

    lxc.network.type = veth
    lxc.network.link = br0 # replaced original lxcbr0
    lxc.network.flags = up
    lxc.network.hwaddr = 00:16:3e:xx:xx:xx

  $ (emacs) C-x C-c

Then I checked if the environment is ok to run containers

  $ sudo lxc-checkconfig

Now the environment is set up and we can create and run containers in it.


================================== DEBUGGING ==================================

(1) I got a bug where I could not figure out why the function
    'c->export_container' returned random numbers. I tried debugging by adding
    new functions to the file 'lxccontainer.c' and changing the return types
    but they always gave random results.

    First I suspected that it may have to do with the build system, since the
    'lxccontainer.c' was compiled into a shared library. To verify that I did
    not need to mess around with Makefiles, I looked at the git history of all
    changes made to files 'lxccontainer.h', 'lxccontainer.c', and
    'Makefile.am' with the commands

      $ git log --follow -p src/lxc/lxccontainer.h
      $ git log --follow -p src/lxc/lxccontainer.c
      $ git log --follow -p src/lxc/Makefile.am

    The history showed no major changes made to the build system so I was
    realized that it had nothing to do with the build system.

    Then I figured that this might have something to do with the file system
    layout so I simply created a container environment for developing LXC.
    Inside the container I installed the following packages with

      $ sudo apt-get install autotools-dev automake autoconf pkg-config
      $ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic

    I also configured the contianer to allow nested containers by adding the
    following lines to the container configuration file

      lxc.mount.auto = cgroup
      lxc.aa_profile = lxc-container-default-with-nesting

    For my container I added it to the file '/var/lib/lxc/p1/config'.
    Inside the container I installed my version using the following commands

      $ ./autogen.sh
      $ ./configure && make && sudo make install

    Then I created a container and ran my tests

      $ sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n p0
      $ sudo lxc-export -n p0 -e out

    This test finally returned the correct return values as I had put in the
    function in 'lxccontainer.c'.

(2) Within the container I tried cloning a container but it didn't work
    well. Nested containers were a mess so I reverted to my original style but this time I knew that I had to put the binaries under '/usr/local/' and not in my local development directory. I repeated the steps above

      $ sudo apt-get install autotools-dev automake autoconf pkg-config
      $ ./autogen.sh
      $ ./configure && make && sudo make install

    This time, my 'lxc-export' program worked and cloning also worked.
